# CollatzSequence
Program to find the highest number below given limit that has highest collatz sequence length
Problem statement: Program that find the starting number below a given limit that has the longest Collatz sequence. The program should be called with a single number as the command line parameter. This number is the upper limit below which the longest chain should be found. Two versions are provided, program one will optimise for code simplicity and low memory usage. Program two sacrifices some simplicity and memory for significant reduction in CPU time required.
